nodemcu lua branch

Base on https://github.com/frizzby/esp8266-rgb-led

Trying conversion to ws2812b led strip

Color change is ok
Brightness is ok
Saturation : actually answer to discomode + and - pressing - on investigation...

Works with domoticz and Wifi controller 2.0 android app

For Domoticz : 
- create new hardware --> milight/applamp/limitless
- Set mode on RGB
- Enjoy !

Made with nodemcu 0.9.6 firmware + ws2812 module
